## Project Overview:
Sync is a decentralized payment protocol enabling instant fiat-to-crypto transactions on StarkNet. By combining non-custodial wallets, automated liquidity bridging, and StarkNet's ZK-rollup efficiency, Sync allows users to spend fiat (e.g., NGN, USD) while seamlessly tapping into crypto liquidity for settlements.
